# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Agent

This repository is for experimenting with GitHub agents using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What is Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It acts as a universal standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, simplifying the process of integrating LLMs with various tools and data repositories.

### Key Features:

*   **Standardized Integration**: MCP provides a consistent way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools, much like USB-C offers a standard for physical device connectivity.
*   **Client-Server Architecture**: It operates on a client-server model where a host application (like an IDE or AI tool) connects to various servers that expose specific capabilities and data.
*   **Extensibility**: Developers can build their own MCP servers to expose data from local files, databases, or remote services.
*   **Security**: MCP emphasizes user consent and control, ensuring data privacy and safe tool execution.

### Core Components:

*   **MCP Hosts**: Applications that use MCP to access data.
*   **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that connect to servers.
*   **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose data and tools via MCP.

### Getting Started

You can learn more about MCP and start building with it by visiting the official documentation and resources:
